[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/xero-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@john-zhang-dev/xero-mcp)

This MCP server allows Clients to interact with [Xero Accounting Software](https://www.xero.com).

## Get Started

1. Make sure [node](https://nodejs.org) and [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) are installed.

2. Create an OAuth 2.0 app in Xero to get a _CLIENT_ID_ and _CLIENT_SECRET_.

   - Create a free Xero user account (if you don't have one)
   - Login to Xero Developer center https://developer.xero.com/app/manage/
   - Click New app
   - Enter a name for your app
   - Select Web app
   - Provide a valid URL (can be anything valid eg. https://www.myapp.com)
   - Enter redirect URI: `http://localhost:5000/callback`
   - Tick to Accept the Terms & Conditions and click Create app
   - On the left-hand side of the screen select Configuration
   - Click Generate a secret

3. Modify `claude_desktop_config.json` file

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "xero-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "xero-mcp@latest"],
         "env": {
           "XERO_CLIENT_ID": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
           "XERO_CLIENT_SECRET": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
           "XERO_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:5000/callback"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Restart Claude Desktop

5. When the Client decides to access a Xero tool for the first time, a Xero login page will pop up to ask your consent. Complete the auth flow and manually close the web page (as the Xero page will not auto close in this version)

   __Privacy alert: after completing the Xero OAuth2 flow, your Xero data may go through the LLM that you use. If you are doing testing you should authorize to your [Xero Demo Company](https://central.xero.com/s/article/Use-the-demo-company).__
